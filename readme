A free server for the game of Points.

It’s written in Scala language, using
Liftweb as a web framework,
SBT as a build tool,
akka as the main actor system (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model),
squeryl as a database wrapper (ORM),
scalatest as a testing framework,
git as a version control system,

It is WIP (work in progress), many things may change.

Pull requests and questions are welcomed.:)
The technologies used in the project are really cool and modern -- this
might be the main motivation for experienced developers to join.
Another motive may be to write the server itself, for people interested in points game.


==== About English and Russian in the project ====

All code is written in english.
Documentation, ToDos and other such stuff is written in russian right now.
If a non-russian-speaking developer would be interested to join the project
we'll be interested to translate such info and keep it in english afterwards.

A free server for the game of Points.

It’s written in Scala language, using
LiftWeb as a web framework,
SBT as a build tool,
akka as the main actor system (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model),
squeryl as a database wrapper (ORM),
scalatest as a testing framework,
git+github as a version control system,

All code is written in english.
Documentation, ToDo's and other such stuff is written in russian right now.
If a non-russian-speaking developer would be interested to join the project
we'll be interested to translate the info and keep it in english afterwards.

Pull requests and questions are welcomed.:)
The technologies used in the project are really cool and modern -- this
might be the main motivation for experienced developers to join.
Another motive may be to write the server itself, for people interested in points game.
All info below is in russian.

NOTICE 2014-03-12

The server IS open-sourced but is NOT really ready yet.
Please, don't spend too much time looking in it -- many things will change in near future.
I'll remove/edit this notice once the server will be closer to being ready.
